# Video Clip

The '@webav/av-canvas' package from the WebAV project provides quick implementation of **video clips** in the browser environment.

The DEMO demonstrates the basic capabilities of the video editing software.

- Add/remove assets (video, audio, images, text).
- Split (crop) assets.
- Control the spatial properties of the material in the video (coordinates, rotation, scaling).
- Control temporal properties (offset, duration) of the material in the video.
- Live preview playback.
- Pure browser environment for video generation.
